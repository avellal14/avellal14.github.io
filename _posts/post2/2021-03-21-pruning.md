**Why Pruning?**
As deep learning’s popularity continues to explode, an increasing number of companies
have begun to rely on cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to deliver core product
functionality to users. However, developing and deploying large neural networks is an
extremely [resource-intensive process](https://future.a16z.com/new-business-ai-different-traditional-software/)
that quickly becomes a core business cost for these companies. Furthermore, many applications of deep learning, 
ranging from mobile phone applications to robotic control systems, require rapid model inference.
This is very difficult to accomplis with large and unwieldy models.

Ongoing research in neural network pruning aims to address many of these issues by
exploring techniques for removing extraneous parameters from neural networks without
compromising their accuracy. Smaller networks naturally require less space and are
faster and cheaper to both train and deploy, making this line of work particularly
important for those in industry actively seeking to reduce the costs surrounding model
development and deployment.

**Deep Learning 101**
Before we dive into things, let’s quickly cover some important terms and concepts that
will be referred to in subsequent sections. *Deep learning models*, also known as *neural
networks*, are a class of machine learning algorithms that have found immense success
in recent years. For simplicity’s sake, we will focus on *supervised learning tasks*, where
we are provided with a set of datapoints and a corresponding set of labels describing
these datapoints. Supervised learning with neural networks has been most successful
in the domains of vision (image data) and language (text data). The goal is to learn a
function, *f*, that maps a given datapoint (such as an image or piece of text) to its
corresponding label. *f* is parameterized by a neural network, which is defined by
composing many matrix multiplications and subsequent nonlinearities on top of each
other. For example, we can define *f(x)* for an input *x* and label *y* as follows, where *w_1* and
*w_2* are coefficient matrices known as weights and *h_1* and *h_2* are nonlinear functions that
are applied elementwise to their inputs: *f(x) = h_2(w_2(h_1(w_1(x)))*. This can also be viewed as
passing an input through consecutive layers of interconnected neurons where the
connections between neurons are quantified using the weight matrices (*w_1* and *w_2*).
Training a neural network refers to the process of iteratively updating the network’s
weights so that its predictions on the given datapoints closely match the provided data
labels. Neural networks can be trained using a variety of different optimization
algorithms that provide instructions on how to update the weights in order to bestmatch the network 
outputs to the labels. Model inference refers to the process of obtaining a trained network’s predictions on 
new data in production.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
