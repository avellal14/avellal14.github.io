*Why Pruning?*

As deep learning’s popularity continues to explode, an increasing number of companies
have begun to rely on cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to deliver core product
functionality to users. However, developing and deploying large neural networks is an
extremely (resource-intensive process){https://future.a16z.com/new-business-ai-different-traditional-software/}
that quickly becomes a core business cost for these companies. Furthermore, many applications of deep learning, 
ranging from mobile phone applications to robotic control systems, require rapid model inference.
This is very difficult to accomplis with large and unwieldy models.

Ongoing research in neural network pruning aims to address many of these issues by
exploring techniques for removing extraneous parameters from neural networks without
compromising their accuracy. Smaller networks naturally require less space and are
faster and cheaper to both train and deploy, making this line of work particularly
important for those in industry actively seeking to reduce the costs surrounding model
development and deployment.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
