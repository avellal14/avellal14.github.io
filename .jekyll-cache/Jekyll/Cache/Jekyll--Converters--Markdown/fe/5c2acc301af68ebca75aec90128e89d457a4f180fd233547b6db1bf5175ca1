I"Á<p><strong>Why Pruning?</strong> <br />
As deep learningâ€™s popularity continues to explode, an increasing number of companies
have begun to rely on cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to deliver core product
functionality to users. However, developing and deploying large neural networks is an
extremely <a href="https://future.a16z.com/new-business-ai-different-traditional-software/">resource-intensive process</a>
that quickly becomes a core business cost for these companies. Furthermore, many applications of deep learning, 
ranging from mobile phone applications to robotic control systems, require rapid model inference.
This is very difficult to accomplish with large and unwieldy models.</p>
