* **Spring 2021 - Spring 2022: Student Researcher, Duke Statistical Science Department (Supervised by Prof. Jason Xu):** <br>
Developed a more generalized formulation of the power k-means clustering algorithm. Our ICML paper is [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/vellal22a/vellal22a.pdf), and the code is [here](https://github.com/avellal14/bregman_power_kmeans).

* **Fall 2018 - Spring 2020: Student Researcher, Carl E. Ravin Advanced Imaging Laboratory (Supervised by Prof. Maciej Mazurowski):** <br>
Designed general adversarial networks to normalize breast MRIs produced by different types of MRI scanners. The paper detailing our work can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260721002996?via%3Dihub).

* **Summer 2017 - Summer 2018: Computational Pathology Intern at Harvard Medical School (Supervised by Prof. Jan Heng):** <br>
Engineered a deep learning pipeline to quantitatively analyze digital biopsy images of benign breast disease patients. The papers resulting from this project can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/jncics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jncics/pkaa119/6081057?guestAccessKey=22d40f06-4c8f-488b-9f1f-46b283fe4da5), [here](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/30/4/608/670681/Early-Life-and-Adult-Adiposity-Adult-Height-and) and [here](https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-021-01447-2).
