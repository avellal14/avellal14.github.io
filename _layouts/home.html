Hi! I'm Adithya Vellal, and I'm a student at Duke studying a combination of computer science, math, and statistics.
My 


I studied computer science at Brown and graphic design at RISD. Along the way, I interned at Figma, Facebook Design, and KAYAK. At school I also helped organize Hack@Brown, Brown's annual student hackathon.

I'm interested in many things: the web, financial technology, distributed systems, startups, technology in emerging markets (particularly India), and user experience design. I rarely write, occasionally read books, and often play chess.

You can email me at avellal14@gmail.com, or find me on Twitter.
